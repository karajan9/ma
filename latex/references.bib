    abstract = { Calcium rubidium nitrate, 2Ca(NO3)2−3RbNO3 (CRN), has been studied in its molten and glassy states using 87Rb NMR techniques. In the solid phase asymmetric and smeared quadrupole perturbed spectra of the central Rb resonance reflect a highly disordered ionic local structure. At low temperatures, T < 80 K, the spin−lattice relaxation times follow a power law, T1 ∝ T-α with α = 3. A local T1 minimum near T = 145 K reveals the slow down of the 3-fold rotation of the planar nitrate group. The NMR results are compared with the conductivity relaxation in CRN. }

This is preceded by a brief review of nuclear spin relaxation in solids which includes a discussion of the appropriate spin-dependent interactions and the various relaxation rates which can be measured. Also, the link between nuclear spin relaxation and dielectric relaxation is discussed. Where possible and/or appropriate each of the spectral densities is expressed as a continuous distribution of Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound (or Debye) spectral densities 2ξ /(1 + ξ2 ω2) for nuclear Larmor angular frequency ω and correlation time ξ. The spectral densities are named after their originators or the shape of the distributions of correlation times or both and are (1) Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound or δ-function, (2) Havriliak-Negami, (3) Cole-Cole, (4) Davidson-Cole, (5) Fang, (6) Fuoss-Kirkwood, (7) Bryn Mawr, (8) Wagner or log-Gaussian, (9) log-Lorentzian, and (10) Fröhlich or energy box. The Havriliak-Negami spectral density is related to the Dissado-Hill theory for dielectric relaxation. The spectral densities are expressed in a way which makes them easy to compare with each other and with experimental data. Many plots of the distributions of correlation times and of the spectral densities vs. various correlation times characterizing the distributions are given."

    abstract = { The high-temperature phases of sodium orthophosphate, HT-Na3PO4, and of the solid solutions (Na2SO4)x−(Na3PO4)1-x are characterized by their plastic crystalline state with dynamically disordered PO43- and SO42- anions and a remarkably high cation conductivity. Since HT-Na3PO4 possesses a fully occupied cation sublattice (no vacancies), it has been proposed that cation transport and anion reorientations are dynamically coupled (“paddle-wheel mechanism”). However, no direct evidence for this coupling has been reported. In the present study, the validity of this mechanism is investigated on the basis of 23Na and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Temperature-dependent measurements of the static 31P linewidth indicate that in the solid solutions with 0.04 ≤ x ≤ 0.25 the acceleration of sodium ionic mobility is closely correlated with the acceleration of phosphate rotational motion, associated with a second-order phase transition near 400 K. Temperature-dependent measurements of the 23Na longitudinal and transverse relaxation times have been analyzed using the theory of quadrupolar relaxation under nonextreme narrowing conditions. Consistent with theoretical predictions sizeable dynamic frequency shifts are detected. All of the data are consistently analyzed quantitatively in terms of two distinct motional processes. A low-temperature process, whose relaxation strength is independent of sample composition, is clearly accelerated by the onset of fast anion rotation occurring at the second-order phase transition temperature. In addition, a high-temperature process, which is almost absent in HT-Na3PO4 but whose importance increases with increasing sulfate content, signifies vacancy hopping. This dependence on composition is easily understood because the substitution of PO43- by SO42- generates cation vacancies. The activation energies of both processes are near 0.45 eV, and the corresponding timescales grow increasingly similar with increasing sodium sulfate content. Altogether, the results give strong evidence for a dynamic coupling between anionic reorientation and cation diffusion, supporting the concept of a paddle-wheel mechanism. }

It is shown that DISPA plots provide a convenient aid for studying these relationships. It is also demonstrated that whenever extreme narrowing does not obtain, “null-time” studies provide a simple means for separating the various relaxation parameters of this spin system. Mixing effects of the observing pulse are also considered."
