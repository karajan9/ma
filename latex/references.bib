    abstract = { Calcium rubidium nitrate, 2Ca(NO3)2−3RbNO3 (CRN), has been studied in its molten and glassy states using 87Rb NMR techniques. In the solid phase asymmetric and smeared quadrupole perturbed spectra of the central Rb resonance reflect a highly disordered ionic local structure. At low temperatures, T < 80 K, the spin−lattice relaxation times follow a power law, T1 ∝ T-α with α = 3. A local T1 minimum near T = 145 K reveals the slow down of the 3-fold rotation of the planar nitrate group. The NMR results are compared with the conductivity relaxation in CRN. }

This is preceded by a brief review of nuclear spin relaxation in solids which includes a discussion of the appropriate spin-dependent interactions and the various relaxation rates which can be measured. Also, the link between nuclear spin relaxation and dielectric relaxation is discussed. Where possible and/or appropriate each of the spectral densities is expressed as a continuous distribution of Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound (or Debye) spectral densities 2ξ /(1 + ξ2 ω2) for nuclear Larmor angular frequency ω and correlation time ξ. The spectral densities are named after their originators or the shape of the distributions of correlation times or both and are (1) Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound or δ-function, (2) Havriliak-Negami, (3) Cole-Cole, (4) Davidson-Cole, (5) Fang, (6) Fuoss-Kirkwood, (7) Bryn Mawr, (8) Wagner or log-Gaussian, (9) log-Lorentzian, and (10) Fröhlich or energy box. The Havriliak-Negami spectral density is related to the Dissado-Hill theory for dielectric relaxation. The spectral densities are expressed in a way which makes them easy to compare with each other and with experimental data. Many plots of the distributions of correlation times and of the spectral densities vs. various correlation times characterizing the distributions are given."

    abstract = { The high-temperature phases of sodium orthophosphate, HT-Na3PO4, and of the solid solutions (Na2SO4)x−(Na3PO4)1-x are characterized by their plastic crystalline state with dynamically disordered PO43- and SO42- anions and a remarkably high cation conductivity. Since HT-Na3PO4 possesses a fully occupied cation sublattice (no vacancies), it has been proposed that cation transport and anion reorientations are dynamically coupled (“paddle-wheel mechanism”). However, no direct evidence for this coupling has been reported. In the present study, the validity of this mechanism is investigated on the basis of 23Na and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Temperature-dependent measurements of the static 31P linewidth indicate that in the solid solutions with 0.04 ≤ x ≤ 0.25 the acceleration of sodium ionic mobility is closely correlated with the acceleration of phosphate rotational motion, associated with a second-order phase transition near 400 K. Temperature-dependent measurements of the 23Na longitudinal and transverse relaxation times have been analyzed using the theory of quadrupolar relaxation under nonextreme narrowing conditions. Consistent with theoretical predictions sizeable dynamic frequency shifts are detected. All of the data are consistently analyzed quantitatively in terms of two distinct motional processes. A low-temperature process, whose relaxation strength is independent of sample composition, is clearly accelerated by the onset of fast anion rotation occurring at the second-order phase transition temperature. In addition, a high-temperature process, which is almost absent in HT-Na3PO4 but whose importance increases with increasing sulfate content, signifies vacancy hopping. This dependence on composition is easily understood because the substitution of PO43- by SO42- generates cation vacancies. The activation energies of both processes are near 0.45 eV, and the corresponding timescales grow increasingly similar with increasing sodium sulfate content. Altogether, the results give strong evidence for a dynamic coupling between anionic reorientation and cation diffusion, supporting the concept of a paddle-wheel mechanism. }

	abstract = {{NMR} spectroscopy is the most valuable and versatile analytical tool in chemistry. While excellent monographs exist on high-resolution {NMR} in liquids and solids, this is the first book to address multidimensional solid-state {NMR}. Multidimensional techniques enable researchers to obtain detailed information about the structure, dynamics, orientation, and phase separation of solids, which provides the basis of a better understanding of materials properties on the molecular level.Dramatic progress-much of it pioneered by the authors-has been achieved in this area, especially in synthetic polymers. Solid-state {NMR} now favorably competes with well-established techniques, such as light, x-ray, or neutron scattering, electron microscopy, and dielectric and mechanical relaxation.The application of multidimensional solid-state {NMR} inevitably involves use of concepts from different fields of science. This book also provides the first comprehensive treatment of both the new experimental techniques and the theoretical concepts needed in more complex data analysis. The text addresses spectroscopists and polymer scientists by treating the subject on different levels; descriptive, technical, and mathematical approaches are used when appropriate. It presents an overview of new developments with numerous experimental examples and illustrations, which will appeal to readers interested in both the information content as well as the potential of solid-state {NMR}. The book also contains many previously unpublished details that will be appreciated by those who want to perform the experiments. The techniques described are applicable not only to the study of synthetic polymers but to numerous problems in solid-state physics, chemistry, materials science, and biophysics. Key Features* Presents original theories and new perspectives on scattering techniques* Provides a systematic treatment of the whole subject* Gives readers access to previously unpublished material* Includes extensive illustrations},

	abstract = {The observation of nuclear quadrupole interactions in amorphous solids provides a unique possibility of obtaining information about the angular distribution of local ionic coordinations, complementary to the information about radial distributions deduced from x-ray and neutron diffraction and from extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements. In the present paper the relation between ionic coordinations and the distribution of electric field gradients ({EFG}) is investigated. It is shown that the distribution function P(Vzz,η) of the splitting parameters Vzz (the electric field gradient) and η (the asymmetry parameter) in general yields zero probability both for Vzz=0 and for η=0. For solids which are isotropic on the average, the distribution function of the components Vik of the {EFG} tensor depends only on two variables, the invariant functions of the tensor components [Det(Vik) and ΣV2ik]. Expressions for these quantities in terms of the radial coordinates of the ions causing the {EFG} and of the bond angles between pairs of ions are given. For amorphous solids with random ionic coordination an analytic approximation for the distribution function P(Vzz,η) is derived. This function is strongly dominated by the distribution of ions in the first coordination shell. The results are applied to the analysis of Mössbauer spectra of Gd155 in amorphous Gd-Ni alloys.},
