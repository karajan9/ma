For simple exchange processes it is shown that the calculated exchange patterns depend sensitively on the jump angles, the tensor parameters, and the rotation axes characterizing the geometry of the underlying molecular motion. The inclusion of other interactions is discussed. To demonstrate the feasibility of the experimental method a two-dimensional second-order quadrupolar exchange spectrum was recorded for a clathrate hydrate using oxygen {NMR}. Simulations based on a motional model involving a six-site jump capture the essential features of the experimental results.},

	abstract = {Oxygen-17 stimulated-echo spectroscopy is a novel nuclear magnetic resonance({NMR}) technique that allows one to investigate the time scale and geometry of ultraslow molecular motions in materials containing oxygen. The method is based on detecting orientationally encoded frequency changes within oxygen’s central-transition {NMR} line that are caused by second-order quadrupolar interactions. In addition to the latter, the present theoretical analysis of various two-pulse echo and stimulated-echo pulse sequences takes also heteronuclear dipolar interactions into account. As an experimental example, the ultraslow water motion in polycrystals of tetrahydrofuran clathrate hydrate is studied via two-time oxygen-17 stimulated-echo correlation functions. The resulting correlation times and those of hexagonal ice are similar to those from previous deuteron {NMR} measurements. Calculations of the echo functions’ final-state correlations for various motional models are compared with the experimental data of the clathrate hydrate. It is found that a six-site model including the oxygen-proton dipolar interaction describes the present results.},

However, the derivation has relied on deriving the corrections to the energy levels through somewhat laborious calculations. Only when the transitions between the levels were calculated was it revealed that the corrections to the transition frequency were zero. In this paper, we use Liouville-space methods to work with the transitions directly. Application of a recently published [A.D. Bain, Exact calculation, using angular momentum, of combined Zeeman and quadrupolar interactions in {NMR}, Mol. Phys. 101 (2003) 3163–3175] selection rule for the quadrupole coupling leads to a very simple proof that third-order corrections to the central and other symmetrical transitions are zero. The simplicity of the proof suggests there is a fundamental symmetry involved.},

The results are compatible with an intrinsically exponential response.

During discharge, a cell plates the metal of an anode of high-energy Fermi level such as lithium or sodium onto a cathode current collector with a low-energy Fermi level; the voltage of the cell may be determined by a cathode redox center having an energy between the Fermi levels of the anode and that of the cathode current collector. This strategy is demonstrated with a solid electrolyte that not only is wet by the metallic anode, but also has a dielectric constant capable of creating a large electric-double-layer capacitance at the two electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

	abstract = {Hyperfine studies of disordered materials often yield the distribution of the electric field gradient ({EFG}) or related quadrupole splitting ({QS}). The question of the structural information that may be extracted from such distributions has been considered for more than fifteen years. Experimentally most studies have been performed using Mössbauer spectroscopy, especially on \#\#{IMG}\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/10/47/020/img5.gif] . However, {NMR}, {NQR}, {EPR} and {PAC} methods have also received some attention. The {EFG} distribution for a random distribution of electric charges was for instance first investigated by Czjzek et al [1] and a general functional form was derived for the joint (bivariate) distribution of the principal {EFG} tensor component \#\#{IMG}\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/10/47/020/img6.gif] and the asymmetry parameter \#\#{IMG}\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/10/47/020/img7.gif] . The importance of the Gauss distribution for such rotationally invariant structural models was thus evidenced. Extensions of that model which are based on degenerate multivariate Gauss distributions for the elements of the {EFG} tensor were proposed by Czjzek. The latter extensions have been used since that time, more particularly in Mössbauer spectroscopy, under the name `shell models'. The mathematical foundations of all the previous models are presented and critically discussed as they are evidenced by simple calculations in the case of the {EFG} tensor. The present article only focuses on those aspects of the {EFG} distribution in disordered solids which can be discussed without explicitly looking at particular physical mechanisms. We present studies of three different model systems. A reference model directly related to the first model of Czjzek, called the Gaussian isotropic model ({GIM}), is shown to be the limiting case for many different models with a large number of independent contributions to the {EFG} tensor and not restricted to a point-charge model. The extended validity of the marginal distribution of \#\#{IMG}\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/10/47/020/img7.gif] in the {GIM} model is discussed. It is also shown that the second model based on degenerate multivariate normal distributions for the {EFG} components yields questionable results and has been exaggeratedly used in experimental studies. The latter models are further discussed in the light of new results. The problems raised by these extensions are due to the fact that the consequences of the statistical invariance by rotation of the {EFG} tensor have not been sufficiently taken into account. Further difficulties arise because the structural degrees of freedom of the disordered solid under consideration have been confused with the degrees of freedom of {QS} distributions. The relations which are derived and discussed are further illustrated by the case of the {EFG} tensor distribution created at the centre of a sphere by m charges randomly distributed on its surface. The third model, a simple extension of the {GIM}, considers the case of an {EFG} tensor which is the sum of a fixed part and of a random part with variable weights. The bivariate distribution \#\#{IMG}\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/10/47/020/img9.gif] is calculated exactly in the most symmetric case and the effect of the random part is investigated as a function of its weight. The various models are more particularly discussed in connection with short-range order in disordered solids. An ambiguity problem which arises in the evaluation of bivariate distributions of centre lineshift (isomer shift) and quadrupole splitting from \#\#{IMG}\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/10/47/020/img10.gif] Mössbauer spectra is finally quantitatively considered.},

The {NMR} spectrum is characteristic of the second-order quadrupole powder distribution of the central line, indicating a local non-cubic symmetry at the Rb site and a very small Knight shift. The relaxation rate is found to follow a T2 law above 30 K. This result, together with the ratio of the relaxation for the two Rb isotopes, points towards a quadrupole relaxation mechanism by phonons. Two contributions were found in the nuclear magnetization recovery which have been attributed to the Rb nuclei in the tetrahedral site and in the octahedral site, respectively, with the nucleus in the T-site coupled more strongly to the lattice dynamics. No detectable change in the {NMR} spectrum and/or relaxation rates was found at the superconducting transition located at Tc = 27.5 K.},

	abstract = {The observation of nuclear quadrupole interactions in amorphous solids provides a unique possibility of obtaining information about the angular distribution of local ionic coordinations, complementary to the information about radial distributions deduced from x-ray and neutron diffraction and from extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements. In the present paper the relation between ionic coordinations and the distribution of electric field gradients ({EFG}) is investigated. It is shown that the distribution function P(Vzz,η) of the splitting parameters Vzz (the electric field gradient) and η (the asymmetry parameter) in general yields zero probability both for Vzz=0 and for η=0. For solids which are isotropic on the average, the distribution function of the components Vik of the {EFG} tensor depends only on two variables, the invariant functions of the tensor components [Det(Vik) and ΣV2ik]. Expressions for these quantities in terms of the radial coordinates of the ions causing the {EFG} and of the bond angles between pairs of ions are given. For amorphous solids with random ionic coordination an analytic approximation for the distribution function P(Vzz,η) is derived. This function is strongly dominated by the distribution of ions in the first coordination shell. The results are applied to the analysis of Mössbauer spectra of Gd155 in amorphous Gd-Ni alloys.},

The static two-dimensional (2D) exchange {NMR} experiment provides geometric information, as well as exchange time scales via straightforward and model-free application of Legendre-type orientational autocorrelation functions, particularly for axially symmetric interaction tensors, as often encountered in solid-state2H and13C {NMR}. Under conditions of {MAS}, increased sensitivity yields higher signal-to-noise spectra, with concomitant improvement in the precision and speed of correlation time measurements, although at the expense of reduced angular (geometric) resolution. For random jump motions, one-dimensional (1D)exchange-inducedsidebands ({EIS})13C {NMR} and the recently developed {ODESSA} and time-reverse {ODESSA} experiments complement the static and {MAS} two-dimensional exchange {NMR} experiments by providing faster means of obtaining motional correlation times. For each of these experiments, the correlation time of a dynamic process may be obtained from a simple exponential fit to the integrated peak intensities measured as a function of mixing time. This is demonstrated on polycrystalline dimethylsulfone, where the reorientation rates from {EIS}, {ODESSA}, time-reverse {ODESSA}, and 2D exchange are shown to be equivalent and consistent with literature values. In the analysis, the advantages and limitations of the different methods are compared and discussed.},

Quasielastic neutron scatteringmeasures the full van Hove correlation function for correlation times shorter than 10− 8 s. Spin alignment represents an orientational single particle function for correlation times longer than 10− 4 s. The analogy is based on the fact that geometrical information is obtained in both methods by manipulation of an appropriate phase factor. In neutron scattering this phase factor is Q⋅a in momentum space, where Q is the momentum transfer and a is a jump length. In spin alignment the phase factor is δ Q ⋅τ1 in time space where δ Q specifies the strength of the quadrupole coupling and τ1 is a pulse spacing defining the evolution period. It is shown that the measurements of the elastic incoherent structure factor as a function of Q⋅R and the spin alignment echo height as a function of δ Q ⋅τ1, respectively, yields largely equivalent information about the type of reorientational motion—although at different time scales. Therefore, both methods nicely supplement each other. Some examples (two‐, four‐, and six‐fold jumps of dimethylsulfone, hexamethylenetetramine, and hexamethylbenzene as well as rotational diffusion of polystyrene in its viscous state) are discussed explicitly, where the geometry and time scale of slow molecular reorientations are identified directly.},

We present results on selectively deuterated toluene-d5, which may be one of the molecularly most simple van der Waals glass formers. From two-time correlation functions the time scale of reorientation was obtained slightly above the calorimetric glass transition temperature. The applied stimulated echo method provides a geometry parameter that, in analogy to q-dependent scattering experiments, allows one to investigate the geometry of the elementary rotational process. Continuous time random walk computer simulations were used for the interpretation of the data. It is shown that an isotropic single jump angle model does not describe the toluene rotation, rather the existence of several jump angles is required. Assuming mainly small jump angles {\textless}6° but also some larger angles up to 30° an acceptable fit to the experimental data was obtained. Using four-time correlation functions further properties of molecular reorientation are elucidated. Slow reorienting subensembles can be selected. Their return to the full ensemble occurs on the same time scale as the elementary rotational jump process. In accord with previous investigations in other supercooled liquids, a heterogeneous scenario is found for the rotational dynamics of toluene.},

	abstract = {{NMR} spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing molecular dynamics. For the classic case of two-site exchange, {NMR} spectra go through the transition from exchange broadening through coalescence and then motional narrowing as the exchange rate increases passing through the difference between the resonance frequencies of the two sites. For central-transition spectra of half-integer quadrupolar nuclei in solids, line shape change due to molecular dynamics occurs in two stages. The first stage occurs when the exchange rate is comparable to the second-order quadrupolar interaction. The second spectral transition comes at a faster exchange rate which approaches the Larmor frequency and generally reduces the isotropic quadrupolar shift. Such a two-stage transition phenomenon is unique to half-integer quadrupolar nuclei. A quantum mechanical formalism in full Liouville space is presented to explain the physical origin of the two-stage phenomenon and for use in spectral simulations. Variable-temperature 17O {NMR} of solid {NaNO}3 in which the {NO}3− ion undergoes 3-fold jumps confirms the two-stage transition process. The spectra of {NaNO}3 acquired in the temperature range of 173–413 K agree well with simulations using the quantum mechanical formalism. The rate constants for the 3-fold {NO}3− ion jumps span eight orders of magnitude (102–1010 s−1) covering both transitions of the dynamic 17O line shape.},

	volume = {55},
	abstract = {In solid-state {NMR}, knowledge of the quadrupole coupling constant and the asymmetry parameter from a
powder spectrum allows the determination of the true chemical shift of a line, which can be correlated with the
mean bond angle. However, broad powder patterns are distorted by the dead time of the receiver. The common
way to recover the lost signals is to apply a Hahn echo sequence. As the quadrupole interaction is a single-spin
multiple-energy level interaction, the effects of multiple-quantum {\textasciitilde}{MQ}! transitions during the Hahn echo
sequence are still not well understood. We apply the density-operator approach, combined with the order of
3 5 7
9
coherence description, to predicting the echo locations of half-integer quadrupole spins {\textasciitilde}I5 2 , 2 , 2 , and 2 ! in a
single crystal, the amplitudes of the echoes, and the excitation conditions for obtaining quantitative results on
the spin population ratio. For these purposes, the expression of the {MQ} transition frequency or line shift is
derived. Between the two pulses and during the detection period, the rotation of the crystal at the magic angle
dramatically reduces the homonuclear magnetic-dipole interaction and completely removes anisotropic spectral
broadening due to the heteronuclear magnetic-dipole and the first-order quadrupole interactions; the spin
system is submitted to the true isotropic chemical shift and the second-order quadrupole interactions only
during these two periods. We treat in a unified way the Hahn echoes @including those involved in {MQ}-magic-
angle spinning methodology\# of the central transition representing the refocusing of single-quantum and {MQ}
on-resonance coherences generated by the first pulse. During the pulses the crystal is assumed to be static and
only the first-order quadrupole inteaction is considered; the echo amplitudes representing the refocusing of {MQ}
coherences do not provide us with quantitative results on the spin population ratio. Only that associated with
the refocusing of 1Q coherence gives quantitative results when the two pulse durations are short. Application
to powders requires high-speed computer averaging of the echo amplitude versus one of the two pulse dura-
tions to extract the quadrupole parameters. @S0163-1829{\textasciitilde}97!00714-5\#},

The shape and time scale of the structural relaxation function was thus monitored for times 60 s {\textless} t {\textless} 106 s. The time scale could be compared with results from scanning calorimetry measurements and good agreement was found. From the heat capacity data and from the solid state conductivity the expected liquid state conductivity relaxation time was calculated using several models. The good compatibility of these calculations with the experimental results provides evidence that near the calorimetric glass transition the mobile ions perform concerted motions.},

The real part of the conductivity exhibits a transition from frequency independent to power law behavior as found in most ionic conductors. At high frequencies the frequency exponent approaches unity and becomes larger at low temperatures. In the real part of the dielectric constant, a relaxation step could be observed in {CRN}. A detailed evaluation of the results within the modulus formalism is presented. The imaginary part of the electrical modulus exhibits well developed peaks which are described by the Kohlrausch—Williams—Watts function. All materials studied can be characterized as fragile glass formers. The results are compared to findings in [Ca({NO}3)2]0.4[{KNO}3]0.6 ({CKN}). Low temperature heat capacity, for three nitrate glass-formers, including {CKN}, exhibits weak excess contributions near 10 K.},

A comprehensive description of the experiment and the 2D data processing is given. The information content of 2D exchange spectra of powders is discussed. For discrete jump motions, 2D powder spectra exhibit characteristic ridge patterns originating from the singularities of the 2D lineshape. From the geometry of such ridge patterns the angles of reorientation of the electric field gradient tensors can be determined directly, thus yielding information about the type of motion. The method is illustrated by two examples: the two-site jump of dimethyl sulfone and the six-site jump of hexamethylbenzene.},

	abstract = {{NMR} spectroscopy is the most valuable and versatile analytical tool in chemistry. While excellent monographs exist on high-resolution {NMR} in liquids and solids, this is the first book to address multidimensional solid-state {NMR}. Multidimensional techniques enable researchers to obtain detailed information about the structure, dynamics, orientation, and phase separation of solids, which provides the basis of a better understanding of materials properties on the molecular level.Dramatic progress-much of it pioneered by the authors-has been achieved in this area, especially in synthetic polymers. Solid-state {NMR} now favorably competes with well-established techniques, such as light, x-ray, or neutron scattering, electron microscopy, and dielectric and mechanical relaxation.The application of multidimensional solid-state {NMR} inevitably involves use of concepts from different fields of science. This book also provides the first comprehensive treatment of both the new experimental techniques and the theoretical concepts needed in more complex data analysis. The text addresses spectroscopists and polymer scientists by treating the subject on different levels; descriptive, technical, and mathematical approaches are used when appropriate. It presents an overview of new developments with numerous experimental examples and illustrations, which will appeal to readers interested in both the information content as well as the potential of solid-state {NMR}. The book also contains many previously unpublished details that will be appreciated by those who want to perform the experiments. The techniques described are applicable not only to the study of synthetic polymers but to numerous problems in solid-state physics, chemistry, materials science, and biophysics. Key Features* Presents original theories and new perspectives on scattering techniques* Provides a systematic treatment of the whole subject* Gives readers access to previously unpublished material* Includes extensive illustrations},

Exploiting data acquisition protocols that were recently developed for observing undistorted half-integer quadrupole central transitions, some of the largest quadrupole coupling constants reported to date by high field {NMR} were characterized (e2qQ/h ≈ 300 {MHz}). On repeating such measurements as a function of temperature, certain samples displayed reversible changes that could not be rationalized in terms of the usual temperature dependencies of the nuclear quadrupolar couplings. Instead, dynamic exchange processes between chemically or magnetically inequivalent sites had to be invoked. To quantitatively analyze these processes, the semiclassical Bloch−{McConnell} formalism for chemical exchange was extended to account for second-order quadrupole effects. Insight into the potential nature of the chemical dynamics was also obtained from quantum chemical calculations of the coupling parameters on model systems.},

	abstract = {A theory of dynamic angle spinning ({DAS}) and double rotation ({DOR}) {NMR} is described using average Hamiltonian and irreducible tensor methods. Sideband intensities in {DAS} and {DOR} spectra are analyzed by both the moment and Bessel function methods, and general formulae are derived. Results show that the {DAS} moments depend on the relative rotor phase between the first and the second evolution periods, whereas the second and third {DOR} moments are independent of the relative phase between the inner and outer rotors. Sideband intensities in {DAS} spectra also depend on the relative rotor phases between evolution at the first and second angles, as well as on the ratio of time spent at each angle. Sideband intensities and phases in {DOR} spectra are related to the relative rotor phases between the inner and outer rotors, and the sideband pattern is determined by the ratio of the inner and outer rotor spinning speeds. An inversion symmetry of the odd numbered {DOR} sidebands at the relative rotor phase γr = 0°, 180° permits the elimination of these sidebands. Finally, numerical simulations are implemented and shown to agree with experimental results. Quadrupolar parameters can therefore be recovered either by calculating the second and third moments or by simulating the sideband intensities and phases.},

Multidimensional deuteron magnetic resonance reveals that large jump angles dominate their complex, anisotropic reorientational motion. It involves a sequence of small-angle tilts about locally preferred axes as well as symmetry adapted threefold jumps. The intrinsic dynamics of this glassy crystal is nonexponential and can be fully accounted for in terms of the tilt and jump motion.},

In the solid phase asymmetric and smeared quadrupole perturbed spectra of the central Rb resonance reflect a highly disordered ionic local structure. At low temperatures, T {\textless} 80 K, the spin−lattice relaxation times follow a power law, T1 ∝ T-α with α = 3. A local T1 minimum near T = 145 K reveals the slow down of the 3-fold rotation of the planar nitrate group. The {NMR} results are compared with the conductivity relaxation in {CRN}.},
